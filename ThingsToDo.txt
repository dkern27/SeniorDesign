Setup ROOT
Given a day of muon data to make sure ROOT works

9/12/2016
Find peak of data using TSpectrum

9/19/2016
Fit based on peak

9/26/2016
Do multiple fits on data

10/3/2016
Look at error from parameters of fit
Fit until consecutive fits are same

10/10/2016
Compute our own reduced chi squared to compare to the fit chi squared
Read about TTree
Output VEM (x Max)
Jeff is almost done setting up TTree
Think about handling fit failure or peak failure due to small muon hump or no background hump or something
	-Analyze spectrum to see if it's reasonable or something like that
